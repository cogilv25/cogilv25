Although it doesn't look like it I sincerely swear that I am not a web dev.. ðŸ˜…

I am currently in the process of completing my 4th year Bsc Computing, my dissertation is on [Procedural Generation of Assets for 3D Games Using L-Systems!](https://github.com/cogilv25/Dissertation)

I am interested in Games Development, Low-Level & Embedded Development and obscure / creative concepts (like L-Systems!).

I am always intrerested in opportunities whether very specific to my interests or otherwise! If you have a cool project you think I might be interested in or you just think I am a cool guy feel free to hit me up!
